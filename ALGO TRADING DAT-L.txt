Motivation & Summary 
We wanted to build an Unstoppable Trading Algorithm
Artificial Neural Net (ANN)
Thorough examination of data
Classification
Supervised Model
Signals Generated by Technical Indicators
8 and 20-day EWMA Crossover
20, 50, and 100-day SMA Crossover
12 and 26-day EWMA Crossover and MACD signal


DATA CLEAN UP & MODEL TRAINING

Model Parameters 
Alpacas
Microsoft Stock data (“MSFT”)
5 years of data: June 1, 2017- June 1, 2022
Pandas ewm function and “closing price” avg.
8-day EWMA
20-day EWMA
Simulated Buy & Sell positions using “closing price” + 8-EWMA & 20-EWMA crossover
Calculated ROI on $10,000 using our simulated strategy

Artificial Neural Network
The 8 and 20 day EWMA were the features for our model
Used signal indicators as our target
3 hidden layers
Sigmoid and Tanh
Binary crossentropy
When fitting the model, we ran it for 50, 100 and 500 epochs, comparing the results

Unanticipated Problems

Shift -1 (predicting future price from data)
Slight Lag with Buy & Sell Indicators (Our sell signals would come slightly after the price dip. Our buy signals are also slightly after the rally in price)
Inability to account for changes in results based on the stock we execute our model on. (TSLA has drastically different Recall & Precision when compared to MSFT)

*SUPERVISED MODEL XG BOOST

XGBoost Regressor Model
Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGB):
 is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree	
Gradient Boosting: creates and improves weak models (and their errors) with a dataframe and combines them to generate a strong model
For example:  creating shallow columns, 
using data that some may filter out like the ‘vwap’ column 
taking the difference of the high and low price and creating a new column
Creating lag columns

DISCUSSION

Findings & Final Conclusions
The safe approach is the best approach.
When we tested our model on volatile Stock like TSLA we had a greater return than on less Volatile stock like MSFT.
Our Model showed great recall and a solid precision scores. 
MSFT 12.5% ROI
TSLA 178% ROI
