# ALGO TRADING DAT-L 
### Domenic Rhedrick, Ayana Martinez, Tempest Bowden, Liam Kelly

# Motivation and Summary 
## Artificial Neural Net (ANN)
### Thorough examination of data
## Classification
### Supervised Model
### Signals Generated by Technical Indicators
#### 8 and 20-day EWMA Crossover
#### 20, 50, and 100-day SMA Crossover
#### 12 and 26-day EWMA Crossover and MACD signal



# DATA CLEAN UP & MODEL TRAINING
## Alpacas API
### Microsoft Stock data (“MSFT”)
#### 5 years of data: June 1, 2017- June 1, 2022
## Pandas ewm function and “closing price” avg.
### 8-day EWMA
### 0-day EWMA
## Simulated Buy & Sell positions using “closing price” + 8-EWMA & 20-EWMA crossover
## Calculated ROI on $10,000 using our simulated strategy


# Attempted Models
## ANN
### 8 and 20 day EWMA's
### 8 and 20 day EWMA and MACD
### 20, 50 100 SMA's
## XG Boost Regressor
### 8 and 20 day EWMA's 

# Artificial Neural Network
## The 8 and 20 day EWMA were the features for our model
## Used signal indicators as our target
## 3 hidden layers
### Sigmoid and Tanh
### Binary crossentropy
## When fitting the model, we ran it for 50, 100 and 500 epochs, comparing the results

# Model Evaluation 
## Accuracy Score 0.95
## Confusion Matrix
### Precision vs. Recall
## Classification Report
